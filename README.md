# iQIYI-homepage
Tried to mimic the homepage of iQIYI, my first project : )

This project used HTML5 CSS3, javascript and jquery to finish the outlook of the iQIYI webpage with some interactions. Key take-aways would be:

1. how to write a carousel using jquery only, no pluggings or bootstrap
2. use CSS3 animation to switch two pictures and no need for any js or jquery code (simplest carousel of only two pictures)
3. use CSS3 animation to zoom in pictures
4. implement the flex position to display elements with ease
5. how to pop up a new window/slidedown-menu using jquery
6. 5-star comments with jquery
7. other small tricks like relative/absolute/ position plus z-index to make small tags on top of content,  box-sizing: border-box to aviod shifting of content, and how to google things when you are in trouble!

For next project I would try to group the js code to sort out the index.js to make modules of code for easier maintainance. Will try bootstrap or React next time to write a page. My javascript/jquery basic knowledge should be extended as well. And more comments to make the source code readable!
